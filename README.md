## 🌍 Global Fertility Trends and South Korea's Demographic Challenge

This project visualizes global fertility rates with a focus on South Korea’s unprecedented low birth rate.  
Using Tableau, I analyzed OECD trends, global fertility heatmaps, and detailed comparisons between South Korea and other countries.

Data sources include **Statista**, **OECD**, **World Bank**, and **KOSIS**.
